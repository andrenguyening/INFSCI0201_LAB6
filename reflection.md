##Inheritance
Inheritance allows us to inherit traits and attributes from a super class. In this case, the super class is the Character class and the subclasses that are inheriting from the Character class are the Enemy and Hero class. The Enemy and Herosubclass is able to use the methods and functinos defined in the Character class.

##Association
The Hero and Enemy class have a association relationship. Each weapon is its own object but each Hero or Enemy has a weapon to which it is associated with. Notice a Character will have a weapon but the weapon does not necessarily ahve to have a Character.

##Encapsulation
We can see encapsulation in our classes. Our Character class encapsulates our name, health, max health, and our attack method. The Hero subclass encapsulates our weapon attribute and our attack and equip methods. We are packaging these items into one singular component called a class
